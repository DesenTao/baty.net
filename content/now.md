A few of the things I’m doing as of  **Monday, January 18, 2021**

- Rearranging my online stuff again. (Medium, baty.blog, archives, etc)
- Also tweaking my "system" (tasks, notes, etc). Again.
- Reading "The Scar" by China Miéville
- Back in Living in [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org) after a diversion using a public [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) database. 
- Oh yeah, we sold [the company](https://fusionary.com/), so I’m now a consultant there, 3 days a week. It’s weird, but exciting.
