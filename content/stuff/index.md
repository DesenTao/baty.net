Here you'll find links to some of my other stuff. By "stuff" I mean pages, sites, photos, info, whatever doesn't fit into the normal flow.


**Weblogs and other publishing experiments**

- [baty.net](https://baty.net/) - You're soaking in it, since 2000
- [rudimentarylathe.org](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/) - My original wiki (using Tiddlywiki)
- [copingmechanism.com](https://copingmechanism.com/) - My occasional blog, mostly about photography.
- [baty.net/roam](https://baty.net/roam) - A public
  [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) database used as a wiki and sort of microblog
- [tilde.club/~jbaty](https://tilde.club/~jbaty) - because nostalgia is strong
  and Paul Ford is my hero

**Photography**

- [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty) - I've been posting photos to Flickr
  since forever. Flickr is still the best photo sharing service, and I'm
  looking forward to what's next now that it's owned by SmugMug.
- I've been using [SmugMug](https://jackbaty.smugmug.com) again recently for
  various galleries.
